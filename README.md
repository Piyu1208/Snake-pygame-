# Snake Game

A simple Snake game built using Python and Pygame.

## Features
- Classic snake movement
- Grid-based gameplay
- Apple spawning at random positions
- Score display
- Collision detection with self and walls

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation
1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install Pygame using pip:
   ```sh
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python snake_game.py
   ```
2. Control the snake using arrow keys:
   - `LEFT` to move left
   - `RIGHT` to move right
   - `UP` to move up
   - `DOWN` to move down
3. Eat the red apple to grow the snake.
4. Avoid colliding with the walls or yourself.
5. The score is displayed at the top of the screen.

## Game Mechanics
- The snake starts with a length of 3.
- When the snake eats an apple, it grows by one segment.
- If the snake collides with itself or the walls, the game resets.

## Future Improvements
- Add sound effects.
- Implement a game over screen.
- Add increasing difficulty levels.
